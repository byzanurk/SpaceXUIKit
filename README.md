### What is VIPER?
**VIPER** is an architectural pattern. It takes its name from the initials of its five core components: **V**iper, **I**nteractor, **P**resenter, **E**ntity, **R**outer.
This structure is based on Clean Architecture and makes the code *more organized*, *testable*, and *maintainable* in large projects.

### Why use VIPER?
VIPER makes the project more organized and understandable. Each part has its own responsibility, whic reduces code complexity. View handles the user interface, Interactor manages the business logic, Presenter prepares the data, Entity represents the data structures and Router manages navigation between screens. This way, the code becomes both testable and easier to maintain and develop.
